THis intends to make one keyword layout that serves for all(or the majority) of the languages of the world.

because today this is still too diverse and that's bad because too many languages and countries use a different layout.  and worst, too commonly in major languages the keys placement change from one language to another. So especially for the ones that type in more than one language it's very irritating/ frustrating that some keys go to different locations . it's better to have a layout with the same disposition of keys that works for all or many languages to keep the same positions that we already are used to.

This helps in touch typing , trains better and easier the muscular memory, makes it easier to type and learn languages ,and makes education/alphabetization easier too.

A standard layout like this also helps reduce cost for manufacturers that could make only one design and sell to all the world. 


The layout includes all accents most special letters and its complete for all major european languages (latin , germanic , and even slavs) works even for asian ones  vietnamese , indonesian ,

I also include more mathematical symbols  to make the typing better , more complete .
I'm also proposing the creation of a new keyboard function for the key ‘.’ or ‘,’ in the numpad.
	-why ? because the fraction divider also changes from language to language . in most langs its “,” comma but in some are ‘.’ . And why is it so bad ? because as you type or use softwares too often the software or even som number field in a site is in english and uses the ‘.’ dot so when you are using a keyboard in other lang  and  type the key in the Numpad it prints ‘,’ and gives error > than u have to use the ‘.’ dot in the letters part of the keyboard which takes more time and it's inconvenient. Or keep changing the language of the system.
	So my proposal for that key is to be implemented as a “fraction divider key” then it will print the appropriate dot or comma every time in every field. (if its implemented)


The base layout will be the ABNT2 , because it's very complete and has more keys . It also has the UK like enter . this is better because the american US keyboard is very bad design , with those long fatty McShifts and McEnter those fatty keys take out space for many additional keys that is needed in many languages to put accents for example , and those also displace some bar [] keys that goes to other different places in the layout and makes for a bad interoperability between other languages.

Also the letters layout used will be qwerty ,  this is a better design because it's the more comm standard , and of course this keyboard will make deprecate layouts like azerty wich are bad for even the languages it was designed as it can't even print all the letters in french.

I will already add a sketch “esboço” in Portuguese that I have been making in a file . It shows how the accents and special letters are made .  The base idea here too , is to not have special letters alone in a keyboard nut made then with typing the accent and then the letter. Because keyboards that have those special letters as a one key are bad for adding unnecessary keys like having ç that can be made with ~+c (in portuguese layouts). ñ that can be made with ~+n (in spanish) 


To-do : 
I'm seting here the bases , ideia , and standards .  it needs the layout to be produced . and it needs the drivers for the systems to work like that , to print the right keys with each combination of key presses
