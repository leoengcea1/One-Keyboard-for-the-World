About the way to type letters with accents or modifications . 

One important definition  of the standard here is that not only the layout is the same for all languages typed but also the process of making the letters should be the same . 
By this I mean , if a letter is ‘e’ with an accent like ‘´’  this should be typed as first the accent ´ then letter e . 
This way of working should be the same for all. 

The biggest mistake many layouts make is to put a accented letter in a key just for it like é è ,
No this should not be like that .Because, not only this is wasteful, because the letter and accent is already in the keyboard, but it's also a bad practice because it changes the way the typing works .  like in German that has 3 extra letters  for ä, ö, and ü . It's bad. You should type umlaut( tremas in pt.br) then the letter  a,e,i,o,u . done! they are all already in the keyboard.

because instead of putting an accent in a letter the person will be searching on the keyboard where the specific letter already with this accent is . This changes the process of typing. That's why it's bad. By making letters always in the same way it makes a standard way of typing accented letters or composed letters that is the same for all languages . This is better . It makes more automatic use , it makes it simpler to change between languages and even learning and getting proficient in typing in new languages becomes faster and easier.

This also applies for the  $ (S cifrão / dollar sign ), it should not have random keys in the keyboard for euro , and others. It should be a letter that makes sense and it should work in the same way . like type $ then e for euro  . this will make $ a modifier key like the accents that wait for the next input , and if not a modifier for other currency sign it prints the standard $
