As said this standart will use qwerty  . but as it will be made in a way that if u want u can change the keys to colemak and it should still work , putting the few keys in new places but all the function using a key will work using this same key in this new position. 

But for dvorak it would probably be a bad change because it also changes the location of the punctuations . but it may also work even.

Keyboard Layout: A Simple Identification Guide (2025)

“As you compare the QWERTY and Dvorak layouts, you’ll notice that they are drastically different from one another, which makes learning the Dvorak layout time-consuming and difficult!
The Colemak layout is a more modern alternative layout that is more similar to the standard QWERTY layout, making it easier to learn and adapt to.
You’ll notice several key placements haven’t moved from QWERTY, including the punctuation marks!
There are only 17 key changes from QWERTY.
”
So colemak has the same idea of making it faster to type but it's simpler to learn and adapt to . also notice that dvorak is “made to be faster to type in ENGLISH ” may not be for other languages.
